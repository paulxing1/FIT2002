Discussion of the deliverables will be the focus of Workshops and Applied Sessions in weeks 9 to 12 of the semester: ●     Individual Submission: ○     Deliverable 1 (30%): Agile Project Foundations [Relevant content: workshop 10; workshop 11; applied 10] ○     Deliverable  2  (40%):  Agile  Planning  and  Sprint  Allocation  [Relevant  content:  workshop  11, applied 11] ○     Deliverable   3   (10%):  Agile   Reflection  and  Professional  Development   [Relevant  content: workshop 11; applied 9; applied 10; applied 11] ●    Team Presentation and Agile Artefacts (10%) [Relevant content: workshop 12; applied 12; Recorded Deep dive] ●    Completeness and correctness of statements; Referencing (10%) ASSIGNMENT TASKSBuilding on the groundwork established in Assignment 2, students will now act as Scrum Team, leading their teams through the execution of their individual projects developed in the previous assignment. This stage   introduces  the   practical   challenges   and   decision-making   processes   typical   in   agile   project environments, requiring students to iteratively develop and refine their project outputs based on real- time feedback and evolving project needs.This shift to a practical, hands-on approach in Assignment 3 ensures that students not only learn about the theoretical aspects of IT project management but also gain valuable experience in applying these principles in a controlled yet dynamic and responsive learning environment. DELIVERABLE 1: Agile Project Foundations Key Focus:  Setting a strong foundation for iterative development by refining your understanding of the problem, the users, and laying groundwork for an agile workflow. Task 1.1 Project Vision and Initial Requirements for your individual project ●     Refine  your  project’s Vision:  Using  the writing guide  provided,  develop  a  clear  project vision statement. Describe what your project aims to achieve, including its scope, elaborate on the value your project offers, and identify the stakeholders who will benefit the most. ●     Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem your project will solve, focusing on the benefits for the game players or end users. ●     High-Level Requirements: Identify and list a minimum of 6 essential features your product (game) must include to meet user needs. Use user-friendly language, avoiding technical jargon, and focus on the benefits to the game players. These features will eventually be included in your product backlog (e.g., “Allow players to easily transform. into different forms to solve puzzles” instead of “Implement a transformation system for character avatars”).Note: Task  1.1  may  have  similarity  and  overlap  with  some  of your  Assignment  1  and  2  deliverables, however,  it should  not  be  a  repetition  of  your  previous  work.  Use  the formative feedback you  have received across your other assignments to refine your project vision. Task 1.2 Scrum PersonaPersonas represent the various types of users who will interact with your game or product. Use the writing guide provided in Moodle for this task to develop two personas that will help you better understand user needs, behaviours, and goals. These personas should be directly related to the type of player or user who will engage with the project you’re developing. Include the follo代 写FIT2002- IT Project Management Semester 2 - 2024 Assignment ThreePython 代做程序编程语言wing details for each persona: ●     Name and Photo: Give each persona a realistic name and include a representative image. ●     Description:  Provide  key  information  about  the  persona’s  background  (e.g.,  age,  occupation, interests, skill level). ●    Goals/Needs: Define the persona’s primary goals and what they want to achieve when interacting with your game. ●     Frustrations/Pain  Points:  Identify  any  challenges  or  frustrations the  persona  might  encounter while playing the game or using the product. Using empathy to guide your  decision-making,  write  a  short  reflection  (50-100  words)  on  how  your persona might benefit from one of the features in the game Task 1.3 Journey Mapping Map Out a Critical User Journey:To ensure your journey map is focused on user-centred design, select one of the personas you developed in Task 1.2 and use it as the basis for mapping a critical user journey. This will help you understand how this specific user type interacts with your game or project.Choose a critical journey that is essential to the success of your project. The journey typically begins when the player becomes aware of a need (e.g., solving a puzzle, completing a level) and concludes when they either make a decision or accomplish their goal. By linking your journey map to the persona, you will be able to empathise with the user, identify their pain points, and propose improvements that make the experience more tailored and engaging. Using the provided writing guide, map out this journey and include the following elements:
Stages: ●    Stage 1. Awareness  Consideration: Describe how the user first becomes aware of the game or product and what factors contribute to their decision to engage. ●    Stage 2.  First Interaction: Detail the user’s first experience with the game mechanics or core product features. ●    Stage 3. Engagement  Problem Solving: Explain how the user interacts with the core features and what challenges they face. ●    Stage 4. Decision Point: Outline the factors influencing whether the user continues to engage with the product or leaves.2. Steps: Detail how the user progresses through each stage, from becoming aware to deciding whether to  continue  using  the  product.  Break  down  these  steps  into  clear  sprint  tasks  that  can  be  tackled iteratively.
Touchpoints: List all interactions the user has with the system, interface, or other people. Identify which interactions can be refined in future sprints. 4. Pain Points: Identify frustrations or inefficiencies the user might face at each stage. Each pain point should translate into a user story or task that can be prioritised in the backlog for future sprints. 5. Ideal Journey Improvements: Propose changes or new features that address the identified pain points. Each improvement should be associated with specific sprints for future development. Note:In real-world Agile projects, the journey map is often revisited and refined after each sprint based on user feedback. However, for this assignment, you are required to submit one version of the journey map as part of your deliverables. Deliverable 1: structure  criteria Deliverable 1 Task criteria Weight Agile Project Foundations Task 1.1 Develop a project vision document and high-level requirements (<350 words) that includes the following: ●     Project’s scope that describes what you are going to create. ●     Describe the core problem your project will address and the overall solution you propose ●     List a minimum of 6 essential features and functionalities your system must have to achieve the refined business     vision. 10% Task 1.2 Develop two scrum personas (< 500 words in total) for your project that includes the following: ●      Name and Photo ●     Description ●     Goals/Needs ●     Frustration and pain points 10% Task 1.3 Journey Mapping (<400 words) ●     Complete a focused journey map for a critical journey within your project. ●     Clearly identify user pain points and potential areas of friction. ●     Propose transformational improvements that align with your project goals. 10% DELIVERABLE 2: Agile Planning and Sprint Allocation Key Focus:  Translating your project vision into actionable sprints, prioritising impactful features, and demonstrating adaptability within an agile framework.Task 2.1 Develop a comprehensive product backlog incorporating five major epics specific to your project. Utilise the writing guide provided in Moodle and include the following essential categories in your product backlog: i. Define Your Epics: ●     Identify 5 major epics that represent the core functionalities of your project. Breakdown each epic into features (smaller epics) as needed. ●     Describe each epic in detail and clearly explain how it contributes to the project’s goals. ●     Link each epic to stakeholder needs or business value to ensure alignment with the project vision. ii. Break Down Features  User Stories: For each epic, create a minimum of 2 specific features, written in user story format: “As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].” Apply the INVEST criteria when writing user stories: ●     Independent: The story should be self-contained. ●     Negotiable: The story should allow room for discussion and flexibility. ●    Valuable: It should provide value to the stakeholders. ●     Estimable: The story should be estimable in terms of effort. ●    Small: It should be small enough to complete within one sprint. ●    Testable: There should be clear acceptance criteria for when the story is complete.iii. Prioritise Strategically: Apply an agile prioritisation method (such as MoSCoW, Kano, or Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)) to your backlog. Ensure that Must Have features are included in the early sprints to address critical stakeholder needs and pain points. Prioritise stories based on business value, risk, and dependencies. iv. Estimate Effort: ●    Assign story points to each user story using techniques like Planning Poker or relative estimation. Be sure to estimate effort based on complexity, risk, and uncertainty. ●     Ensure that effort estimates are realistic, considering the team’s capacity and experience. Task 2.2 Strategic Sprint AllocationYour team faces the challenge of planning a project over three months, divided into five sprints. You've already developed a prioritised list of five major epics (Task 2.1). Now it's time to strategically allocate these epics to sprints, delivering value incrementally while addressing critical pain points. a. Total Duration: 3 months (12 weeks) ●     Number of Sprints: 5 ●    Average Sprint Length: 2.4 weeks per sprint b. Steps for Sprint Allocation: ●     Break Down Large Epics: ○     Review the five epics you defined in Task 2.1 and determine if any epics need to be broken down into smaller sub-epics or features to be distributed across multiple sprints. ○     Example: If you have an epic like “Level Design” in Eidolon’s Veil, it might be broken down into “Initial Environment Design” (Sprint 1) and “Advanced Puzzle Layouts” (Sprint 3). ●     Prioritise Allocate Epics: ○     Allocate  epics  or  sub-epics  to   each  sprint.  Use  an  agile  prioritisation  method  like MoSCoW, Kano, or Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) to ensure that the most critical features (e.g., “Must Haves”) are addressed early. ○     Deliver Incremental Value: Ensure that each sprint delivers a usable, functional piece of the project. This could be a feature that stakeholders can use, test, or provide feedback on at the end of each sprint. ○     Example: For Retro Rivals, Sprint 1 might focus on developing basic racing mechanics and core car physics, while Sprint 2 focuses on implementing the synthwave soundtrack and retro visuals. ●     Resolve Pain Points  Dependencies: ○     Focus on resolving key pain points early in the project, especially those that stakeholders have prioritised. If any features depend on others being completed first, make sure to allocate them to earlier sprints. ○     Example:  For  Cipher  Protocol,  you  might  need  to  complete the  hacking  mechanics  in Sprint 1 before working on more advanced stealth systems in Sprint 2. ●    Theme-Based Sprints (Optional): ○     If   applicable,   organise   sprints   around   broader   themes   such   as   “Core   Gameplay Mechanics,” “User Experience Enhancements,” or “Narrative Development.” This helps create a structured progression in the project. ○     Example:  For Stellar  Nexus, Sprint 1 could be focused on procedural galaxy generation (core   mechanics),   while    Sprint   3    might   focus   on    diplomacy   systems    (narrative enhancements). c. Adaptability: ●    Create  a   Buffer:   Ensure  that  each  sprint   plan  includes  some  buffer  time  to  accommodate unexpected challenges  or  scope  changes.  This  will  allow  your  project  to  remain  flexible  and adaptable to new requirements. ●    Adapt to Changes: Be prepared to adjust your sprint allocations mid-project if new requirements or critical issues arise. Justify how you would manage scope changes, explaining which features might be delayed or reprioritised. d. Justify  Explain Trade-offs: ●     Provide  a  detailed  explanation for why you allocated specific epics to  particular  sprints. This should include any trade-offs you made, such as prioritising core functionality over non-essential features or delaying a less critical feature for a future sprint. ●     Example:  If you delayed implementing a minor feature in Retro Rivals to prioritise core racing mechanics, explain how this decision improves overall project outcomes. e. Critically Analyse Your Plan: ●     Identify any gaps or missing information in your sprint allocation plan and explain how you would address them during the project. ●     Example: If you’re  unsure how long a particular feature might take to develop (e.g., advanced hacking systems in Cipher Protocol), explain how you would gather more information and adjust your plan as necessary.
